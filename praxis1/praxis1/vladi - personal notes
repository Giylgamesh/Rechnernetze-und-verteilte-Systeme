bjees guides notes:
** 2 Types of sockets:
    - Stream Sockets (SOCK_STREAM)
        - Use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
            - error free (If a packet is lost or corrupted, it will be retransmitted)
            - ordered
        - need to maintain open connection
    - Datagram Sockets (DOCK_DGRAM)
         - Use UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
            - error free
            - out of order
        - don't need to maintain open connection (connectionless)
        - may need additional protocol:
            - e.g. if recipient doesn't get anything after 5 seconds, ask the sender to send again.
        - is very fast and doesn't need many resources
